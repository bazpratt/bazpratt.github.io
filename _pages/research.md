I am broadly interested in combinatorial algebraic geometry.

[Combinatorics of m=1 Grasstopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09603) (preprint, with Yelena Mandelshtam and Dmitrii Pavlov) 

Grasstopes are a generalization of amplituhedra. Building on work of Karp and Williams on the m=1 amplituhedron, we show that m=1 Grasstopes consist of regions of a hyperplane arrangement characterized by a sign condition.

[D-Module Techniques for Solving Differential Equations in the Context of Feynman Integrals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11105) (preprint, with Johannes Henn, Anna-Laura Sattelberger, and Simone Zoia)

We use D-module methods to construct series solutions to linear differential equations appearing in the context of Feynman integrals. 
<!---In particular, we implement an algorithm due to Saito, Sturmfels, and Takayama to compute canonical series solutions of regular holonomic D-ideals, and compare them to asymptotic series derived from the respective Fuchsian systems.--->

[On the Geometry of Elliptic Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02971) (2023)

In this paper we classify toric elliptic pairs of Picard number two. These elliptic pairs are used to construct examples of surfaces whose pseudo-effective cone is non-polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density, and, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density.

[Quantum Jacobi forms and sums of tails identities](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357040393_Quantum_Jacobi_forms_and_sums_of_tails_identities)  (2022, with Amanda Folsom, Noah Solomon, and Andrew Tawfeek)

We discover new examples of hypergeometric series which are quantum Jacobi forms, i.e. satisfy a modular transformation property up to an analytic error term.
