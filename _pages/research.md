## Papers: 

* [D-Module Techniques for Solving Differential Equations in the Context of Feynman Integrals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11105) (2023)

We use D-module methods to solve linear differential equations appearing in the context of Feynman integrals. In particular, we implement an algorithm due to Saito, Sturmfels, and Takayama to compute canonical series solutions of regular holonomic D-ideals, and compare them to asymptotic series derived from the respective Fuchsian systems. 

* [On the Geometry of Elliptic Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02971) (2023)

In this paper I classify toric elliptic pairs of Picard number two. These elliptic pairs are used to construct examples of surfaces whose pseudo-effective cone is non-polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density, and, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density.  

* [Quantum Jacobi forms and sums of tails identities](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357040393_Quantum_Jacobi_forms_and_sums_of_tails_identities)  (2022, with Amanda Folsom, Noah Solomon, and Andrew Tawfeek)

We discover new examples of hypergeometric series which are quantum Jacobi forms, i.e. satisfy a modular transformation property up to an analytic error term.
