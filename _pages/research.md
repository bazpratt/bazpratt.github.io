# Papers: 

1. [On the Geometry of Elliptic Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02971) (2023)

In this paper I classified toric elliptic pairs of Picard number two. These elliptic pairs were used to construct examples of surfaces whose pseudo-effective cone is non-polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density, and, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density.  

2. [Quantum Jacobi forms and sums of tails identities](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357040393_Quantum_Jacobi_forms_and_sums_of_tails_identities)  (2022, with Amanda Folsom, Noah Solomon, and Andrew Tawfeek)

We discovered new examples of hypergeometric series which are quantum Jacobi forms, i.e. satisfy a modular transformation property up to an analytic error term.

# Talks:
