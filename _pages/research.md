I am broadly interested in combinatorial algebraic geometry.

<summary><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04610">Wondertopes</a> (preprint, with Sarah Brauner, Chris Eur, and Raluca Vlad)</summary>
<hr>
We provide a new type of positive geometry called a wondertope (wonderful polytope). It is constructed by pulling back an open region of a hyperplane arrangement to the wonderful compatification of the arrangement, then taking the Euclidean closure.

<summary><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10795">The Chow-Lam Form</a> (preprint, with Bernd Sturmfels)</summary>
<hr>
We introduce the Chow-Lam form for subvarieties of the Grassmannian, generalizing the classical Chow form. This gives us universal formulas for projections between Grassmannians and their branch loci.

Combinatorics of m=1 Grasstopes </a>(preprint, with Yelena Mandelshtam and Dmitrii Pavlov) </summary>

<hr>
Grasstopes are a generalization of amplituhedra. Building on work of Karp and Williams on the m=1 amplituhedron, we show that m=1 Grasstopes consist of regions of a hyperplane arrangement characterized by a sign condition.

D-Module Techniques for Solving Differential Equations in the Context of Feynman Integrals </a>(2024, with Johannes Henn, Anna-Laura Sattelberger, and Simone Zoia) </summary>

<hr>
We use D-module methods to construct series solutions to linear differential equations appearing in the context of Feynman integrals. 
<hr>
<!---In particular, we implement an algorithm due to Saito, Sturmfels, and Takayama to compute canonical series solutions of regular holonomic D-ideals, and compare them to asymptotic series derived from the respective Fuchsian systems.--->

<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02971">
On the Geometry of Elliptic Pairs </a>(Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, 2023) </summary>

<hr>
In this paper we classify toric elliptic pairs of Picard number two. These elliptic pairs are used to construct examples of surfaces whose pseudo-effective cone is non-polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density, and, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density.

<summary><a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357040393_Quantum_Jacobi_forms_and_sums_of_tails_identities">Quantum Jacobi forms and sums of tails identities</a> (2022, with Amanda Folsom, Noah Solomon, and Andrew Tawfeek)</summary>
<hr>
We discover new examples of hypergeometric series which are quantum Jacobi forms, i.e. satisfy a modular transformation property up to an analytic error term.
