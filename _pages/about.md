I'm a math major at Amherst College, soon to be a PhD student at (insert your university here if you are in admissions). I am especially interested in algebraic geometry, discrete math, theoretical CS, and everything in the overlaps.

I also sing with [the DQ](https://www.thedq.org/) and rock climb.

This is a blog for me to post explanations of math I am learning. These posts should do (at least one of) the following:

1. Provide examples (zoom in to see inner workings)
1. Provide the category theoretic interpretation (zoom out to get context)
