I am a first year PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by Bernd Sturmfels. I am visiting the IAS in Spring 2023. My mathematical interests include algebraic geometry, discrete math, and applications to physics and theoretical computer science. In my free time, I rock climb, drink coffee, read comics, and sing.
