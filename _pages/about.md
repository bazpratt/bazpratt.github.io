I am a first year PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by Bernd Sturmfels. Before that, I was at Amherst College, where I completed a senior thesis under the guidance of Jenia Tevelev. My mathematical interests include algebraic geometry, discrete math, and applications to physics and theoretical computer science. In my free time, I rock climb, drink coffee, read comics, and sing. I am visiting the IAS in Spring 2023.
