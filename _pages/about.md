I am a third year PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by Bernd Sturmfels. Before that I was at Amherst College, where I completed a senior thesis on elliptic pairs under the guidance of Jenia Tevelev. My mathematical interests include combinatorial algebraic geometry and applications to particle physics. In my free time, I rock climb, run, drink coffee, and read comics.
